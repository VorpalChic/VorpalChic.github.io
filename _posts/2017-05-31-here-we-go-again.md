title: Here We Go Again
---
Alrighty, here comes the typical this is me and here is a little about my life. Okay ready set go! I’m a twenty-eight year old mother from Vancouver, WA. My son is super awesome, and ridiculously funny. I just celebrated my seventh wedding anniversary with my wonderful husband. We met while we were in vocational school, and have really grown up together. I  graduated a couple of year ago, and obtained my degree in web and graphic design. I work as a freelance web designer, and my husband develops the sites. Whew, see that wasn’t too bad. 

So, about a month ago, my husband and I decided to venture into this diet called Keto. Now, this isn’t the first time that I’ve tried Keto. The last time I took on this diet, I lost seventy-five pounds. Yay me right? That’s what I thought for a long time. I lost all this weight, but I got down to a certain weight and became discouraged that I wasn't losing any more weight. How did I break this plateau you may ask? I didn’t, in fact I started gaining weight. I figured I wasn’t going to lose anymore, so I gave up.

You may be thinking, “then why start doing Keto again if you’re just going to end up hitting a plateau? Isn’t the definition of insanity doing the same thing over again expecting different results?” You’d be absolutely correct if I didn’t change a key variable. I don’t believe that the key to this diet is losing weight, it’s becoming healthy. Since eating this way, I’ve conquered my anxiety, stamped out depression and gained a new level of self confidence. My husband’s a long time asthma sufferer, and he has noticed it going into remission. Don’t believe me, that’s okay, it sounds unbelievable.

I’ve come to the realization that I’ve been making myself crazy all these years. I need to be okay with who I am. Easier said than done right? Well, this blog is me working on being okay with myself. I want to share what I find with other people out there who may feel like they are at the same crossroad. We all need a little help sometimes, Lord knows I do. Let me share my experience with you.
