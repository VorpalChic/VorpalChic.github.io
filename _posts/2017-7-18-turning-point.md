title: Turning Point
---

I haven’t written a post in a couple of weeks… Okay a month, but I’ve had a lot of new developments in my life that I’ve been focusing on.

The beginning of this month I hit a pivotal moment in my life. My family and I went to an amusement park for my great niece’s birthday party. Yay, get to spend some quality stress free time with my family, or so I thought … <!--more-->

I LOVE thrill rides! The scarier the better! I purposefully bought the more expensive ride bracelet so I could chain ride the parks thrill-ier rides … I just made that word up. 

I’m standing in line, and finally they start loading the ride. Get into my chair, and the safety bar comes down. OMG this is going to be amazing!! My bar comes back up. “Ma’am, I’m sorry I can’t let you ride. The safety bar wont close.” What? I’m officially too fat to ride on an amusement park ride? You can imagine my embarrassment of having to get off the ride, and walk off the platform in front of three dozen people in line. I was mortified!

Standing on the ground waiting for my nice who was riding the ride, I could feel the tears start to prick at the back of my eyes. I thought to myself, “Okay, that sucked, but I’m not going to let it get me down. So what one ride big deal, I’m working on my weight.” We move onto another ride, and you don’t have to be a psychic to guess what happen next.

As my husband and I were driving home, I kept telling myself I wasn’t going to cry. This wasn’t going to get me down! Yea, I lied. It hurt, it hurt like hell! I started to cry as soon as I got home, and was getting really down on myself. “Why should I exercise if I’m not going to lose any weight?”

After some coaxing from my husband, I came to the realization that I wasn’t going to become healthy without a lot of work. Something inside me changed that day. I swore to myself that I would never be embarrassed like that again. I was going to devote everything I had into making myself healthy, and getting my weight under control. 

Since then, I’ve kept up going to kickboxing three times a week, but I’ve also started biking on the days that I don’t go. I will not let this get the better of me! I will beat this situation, and become stronger for it! And I will go back to that amusement park, and ride that ride 30 time in a row just to show it I can’t be beaten! Great, now I’m fighting with inanimate objects.
