title: What’s Your Excuse?

> “Your body keeps an accurate journal regardless of what you write down…” … Or don’t write down, I’m speaking from personal experience. This is a quote that speaks  volumes to me.  Regardless of how closely I keep track of my body, if I’m not putting in the effort to make a change, nothing will change.

## Words of Wisdom

“I just don’t have the time.” “I have to wait until (insert date here) to start my diet.” “Gah, I’m so out of shape, I just don’t think I could exercise.” “The gym is just too expensive.” “Healthy food is too expensive!” “I don’t know how to cook.”

Tell me, have you ever uttered one of these phrases when the mention of diet or exercise comes into play? I’m beyond guilty of blurting out these excuses, sometimes without even thinking. I mean really who wants to wake up at the ass crack of dawn and go for a jog? I mean this with the most respect as possible, but if you raised your hand, you’re a liar!

There really are a million excuses as to why we can’t exercise, it’s hard for us to find a reason why all those excuses don’t matter. So stop for a moment, and don’t think about eating healthy or exercising. Sometimes this is too much for us to take in. For now, just take all of your excuses and tuck them away in the far reaches of you mind.

While you’re sitting there, hopefully with more mental clarity, start jotting down all the reasons that you need to start living a more active healthy lifestyle. Write down anything that comes to mind, even if it seems insignificant or petty.

Look through the list, my guess is that children, significant others and other loved ones ranked up there. Let’s say the shoe was on the other foot, and you were worried about the health and wellbeing of you loved ones. Would you be receptive to hearing their excuses? That would be a big negative for me!

It’s really up to you to make a difference in your life. No one is going to be able to make you be a better you!

## Start Small

Wait a minute… hold on...You don’t need to jump right up and throw out all your goodies all at once, take your time! Find one small thing you can change, and do that for a week. Drink Coffee in the morning? Try to put a low-calorie sweetener, or no sweetener at all if you’re feeling brave! Drink soda five days a week for lunch? Try switching one of those days with water or another beverage with less sugar. Don’t get enough exercise? Try taking a five to ten minute walk around your neighborhood daily for a week. 

I take part in the [Keto Diet](https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/), but we humans are all different. Something that could be right for me, may not be right for you. Find something that works well for you and try to steer your life in that direction one baby step at a time.
