title: Don't Try, Do!
---

I recently started reading this book titled [“The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck”](http://a.co/8hMCAif) by Mark Manson. Lovely title right? I heard of the book a couple of times in the past, and thought that it was a total joke. You know the books that you buy as gag gifts. Only, once I actually found out it was a honest to goodness self help book, I figured what the hell I’ll read it.

The author gives you a hard core does of reality, in some not so conventional ways. I’ve started reading it a couple of time, but life gets in the way and I keep putting it down. However, I’m going to use this as the first step to my mental rehabilitation, so to speak. Now, I’m not usually into a bunch of self help crap. Once I had an accounting teacher that was really into it, and she pushed it on us like it was a religion. Then of course the kiss-ups in class liked to read them to gain teacher approval. Needless to say, it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Anywho, what Mark Manson shares in this book (at least in the first chapter), is about not trying. Wait what? Yes you read that right, Mark’s approach is learning how to not try. Let me explain. What he means by not trying, is that you shouldn’t try to be something you're not. Giving too many fucks about something you have no control over, is going to leave you feeling inadequate in the long run.

He tells a story of Charles Bukowski and how he went through 30 years of his being rejected from being a writer. Finally, he was given a chance and flourished as a novelist. I know this sounds like the opposite of not trying. He worked hard, and never gave up on his dream. Right?

“It is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t try.” “See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the face that he knew he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly about. He never tried to be anything other that what he was.” (Mark Manson “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck” pgs. 2-3)

Okay, that sounds depressing. However, what I took from that was that he wasn’t trying to be someone he wasn’t. That’s the key to it all. Don’t try to be something you aren’t, you’ll just make yourself miserable. 

This concept goes even deeper. Other self help books talk about focusing on what you lack and visualizing how to make yourself better rather than being content with who you are. I know this is how I’m going to move forward with myself. I want to learn to accept myself for who I am. Of course there are things that I still want to be different about myself, but I need to learn to be okay with who I am even if nothing ever changes. I believe that this is the foundation I need to create to move forward.
